# DietControllApp
Application is my final project after Java bootcamp in Coders Lab.
It's MVC web application written in Java Spring and Hibernate.
Users have ability to add products with their parameters to MySQL database.
Requests to DB are created by Hibernate repositories. It allows to add products with specified quantity to their meals, 
which are saved in DB with specified dates. Thanks to that, every user have it's own meals calendar, 
what allows him to check how many calories and macro he consumed in choosen peroid of time.
When all primary funcionalities will be implemented, I will probably add some jQuery code, to improve the display process and
Java Spring Security, to let users keep their data safe and private.
