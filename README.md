# DietControllApp
This application is my final project after Java bootcamp in Coders Lab.
It's an MVC web application written in Java Spring and Hibernate.

Features:
- Users have the ability to add new products with their parameters to MySQL database.
- Products with their quantity can be added to meals, which are saved to meal calendar with the specified date.
- Finding products by categories(tags) or name search.
- Every user has his own meals calendar and can check how many calories and macro elements he consumed in a chosen period of time.

Future development:
- adding some jQuery code, to improve the display process.
- adding Java Spring Security, to let users keep their data safe and private.# DietControllApp
